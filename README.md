# kresling-structure
Code for the Kresling origami project.

#Kresling 
The Kresling module is drawn as two sets of triangles that are lofted in between using Autodesk Fusion Python API. This results in a Kresling module with uniform sidewall thickness.

#Kresling_thin
The Kresling module is drawn as three sets of triangles that are lofted with smaller angle/hinge thickness. Please see KreslingPDF for explanation of the maths.
